### Hi there, I'm Sebastian Inones ðŸ‘‹. 
#### I've been professionally developing for over a decade now. Yeah ... I'm getting older but not getting rusty ðŸ˜‹

ðŸ”­ I mainly work with .NET ecosystem doing LOB application and also RPA with Selenium. 
I've tasted most of the .NET flavors ranging from Winforms to UWP on the Front-end side and from Windows Services to ASP.NET Core Web API on the backend side (I love that part ðŸ˜‰).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and having fun with React and every single day trying to improve my DevOps skills.

ðŸ“« You can reach me for some job proposals through [<img src="https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/brand/en-us/brand-home/logos/In-Blue-Logo.png.original.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastianinones/) or also take a look at my [<img src="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/inficons/512/stackoverflow.png" width="18"/>StackOverflow Profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3374615/sebastian-inones) in which you can check my questions and answers and mainly the topics I'm most active at.
