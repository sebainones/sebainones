### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sebastian Inones ðŸ˜ƒ. 
I've been professionally developing for over a decade now. Yeah ... I'm getting older but not rusty ðŸ˜‹

ðŸ”­ I mainly work with .NET ecosystem doing LOB application and also RPA with Selenium. 
I've tasted most of the .NET flavors ranging from Winforms to UWP on the Front-end side and from Windows Services to ASP.NET Core Web API on the backend side (I love that part ðŸ˜‰).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and having fun with React and every single day trying to improve my DevOps skills.

ðŸ“« You can reach me for some job proposals through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastianinones/) or also take a look at my [StackOveflow Developer Story](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/3374615) which I try to keep updated as well.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about RPA using Web Automation Frameworks such as Selenium or Telerik Testing Framework, or you can take a look at some of my articles about [Doing RPA with Selenium](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/doing-rpa-withselenium-sebastian-inones/) for the skeptical ones...

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DevOps which something that Im' really keeon on, or you can take a look at some of my articles about [DevOps](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/github-bitbucket-gitlabazure-devops-why-dont-use-them-inones/)
