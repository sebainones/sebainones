### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sebastian Inones ðŸ˜ƒ. 
I've been professionally developing for over a decade now. Yeah ... I'm getting older but not rusty ðŸ˜‹

ðŸ”­ I mainly work with .NET ecosystem doing LOB application and also RPA with Selenium. 
I've tasted most of the .NET flavors ranging from Winforms to UWP on the Front-end side and from Windows Services to ASP.NET Core Web API on the backend side (I love that part ðŸ˜‰).
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and having with React and every single day trying to improve my DevOps skills.
